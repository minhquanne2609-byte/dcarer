  // `width: 100%` is ignored and the table pokes ~50–100px past the card,
  // the blue phase-title bar and the row cells — that card "measures", via
  // measureCaptureWidth (which walks descendants), as wide as the overflow.
  // So it can BE the widest card and still be visually broken: the header
  // row and totals row jut out past the title bar and the card's right edge
  // (in the export: the thin blue tab at the card's top-right, and the
  // clipped right-hand currency column). This was the Phase 1 vs Phase 2
  // "Phase 1 is missing that strip" bug. Pinning that card to the same width

                  Dental implant placement is a procedure in which a Titanium implant post is surgically inserted
                  into the jawbone to replace the root of a missing tooth. Once the bone has successfully
                  integrated with the implant surface, the dentist proceeds with attaching a prosthetic
                  restoration, such as a dental crown, bridge, or denture, ensuring a stable, non-slip fit within
                  the mouth.

          going blank. Deliberately NOT using the .no-print or .fixed
          classes: body.fullpdf-export/.png-export force every .no-print
          AND every .fixed element to display:none (see styles.css) —
          exactly the state this is shown during, and exactly what was
          hiding this element (same as it hides the toolbar it replaces).

          don't touch. */}
